# Branch

You are a busy person, constantly doing pull-reviews and helping other developers whilst also trying to do your own tasks.  You find yourself hopping between lots of branches but you don't want
to keep typing their names out all the time.

`branch` helps by providing a simply interface which:

 * Lists the last 30 branches you checked out.
 * Allows you to switch between them with a single shortcut.
 * Filter search these branches and if there is only a single match, switch to it.
